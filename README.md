# Introduction

This project is home for consumer facing website. In order to create this website, there are other different github projects
that are responsible for their own thing and generate artifacts used by this project

**Flow of information**

```text
forkfactsdb => forkfacts-scripts => forkfacts
```

## [forkfactsdb](https://github.com/bonsaiilabs/forkfactsdb)

- Responsible for setting up database locally with USDA dataset (currently, our only supported dataset)

## [forkfacts-scripts](https://github.com/bonsaiilabs/forkfacts-scripts)

- Responsible for fetching the data from the database and generating data files that can be fed to the Gatsby website
- **Why we need this?**
  - We have specific requirements on what data needs to be shown on each page. Gatsby can connect to a PostgreSQL database,
    however, the query language is GraphQL, **not SQL**. GraphQL does not support writing join queries, which is our requirement.
    Hence, this project was created to generate data files that Gatsby project can ingest and create web pages.

## [forkfacts](https://github.com/bonsaiilabs/forkfacts)

- This repository. It is a gatsby project responsible for creating website as defined in the [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/nhyeaTsg4Jhhzq2PwuvnGk/forkfacts?node-id=811%3A9433)
- While, majority data comes in form of data files (by leveraging forkfacts-scripts project), this project, however,
  still depends on database connection. _TODO: This should be discussed to see if it should be database agnostic_

# Getting Started

## Pre-requisites

- You must have `yarn` installed. Run `brew install yarn` on Mac (assuming you have homebrew) to install `yarn`. For more
  options, follow [`yarn documentation`](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).
- You must have database running locally with dataset. Follow [forkfactsdb](https://github.com/bonsaiilabs/forkfactsdb)
  for setup instructions.
- **Only if you are creating new data files**. You must have forkfacts-script project installed to create scripts in
  order to generate new data files. Follow the [forkfacts-script](https://github.com/bonsaiilabs/forkfacts-scripts) for
  setup instructions.

## Steps

### Clone project

```shell
git clone git@github.com:bonsaiilabs/forkfacts.git
```

**Note - Using multiple Github SSH Keys locally?**  
Before you run `git clone` command, please do not forget the following

- Update the github domain in your `git clone command`. For example, based on your `~/.ssh/config`, your clone command may be  
  `git clone git@github.com-p:bonsaiilabs/forkfacts.git`
- Ensure that your SSH keys are available to your SSH Agent running locally
  - Run `ssh-add -l` to see if keys are listed in the output. If not, follow the next step.
  - Run `ssh-add ~/.ssh/<path_of_your_ssh_private_key>` to add the keys for your SSH Agent.
  - Run `ssh-add -l` to see ensure your SSH keys are available to your SSH Agent.

### Install Dependencies

```shell
cd forkfacts && yarn install
```

### Run the project

#### Development

- Run `yarn develop` to start gatsby project locally. This internally runs `gatsby develop` command. This will start project
  on http://localhost:8000
- Run `yarn storybook` to start storybook. This will run on http://localhost:6006/. (**Note:** You do **not** need database setup
  in order to run this command).

#### Production

- Run `yarn build` to create production build.
- Run `gatsby serve` to start production build locally. It will start project on http://localhost:9000/

It helps form time-to-time to create production build and serve locally to ensure all is well!

# Design

We use Figma, and the latest design is available [here](https://www.figma.com/file/nhyeaTsg4Jhhzq2PwuvnGk/forkfacts?node-id=811%3A9433)

Please use `dev.atwork@yahoo.com` account in Figma (credentials are available in the Password Manager)

# Process

The entire project is managed using GitHub Projects (beta). Currently, the issues are marked with 3 priorities -
`ü•ë High`, `üçâ Medium`, and `üçî Low`. These priorities are open for discussion and should be refined as team finds it necessary.

| What                          | Where                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All issues (as list)          | [Link](https://github.com/orgs/bonsaiilabs/projects/1/views/1) |
| Current Priorities (as board) | [Link](https://github.com/orgs/bonsaiilabs/projects/1/views/5) |

## Steps

1. Assign yourself an **unassigned** ticket from the list of `ü•ë High` priority.
2. Create a feature branch based on latest `main` branch. We are using Semantic Release for automated releases. So, please refer to
   [commit message format](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#commit-message-format) guidelines to indicate the nature of change.
   If you add reference to github issue number ([example](https://github.com/bonsaiilabs/forkfacts/commit/629f3b24656ecbdc07be770a3e33583c9427af24)),
   your commit will be referenced in Github Issue.
3. Early on (with your first commit push itself), create a draft pull requests to ensure builds are running and there are no merge
   conflicts. This can save a lot of time in the integration later. Also, with each PR, chromatic builds are connected to generate
   updated storybook components. This can be of tremndous help during the code review.
4. Once you are done with the work, assign your PR to a reviewer.

## Release

The project is set up to use [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/). As soon as a PR is merged
into the `main` branch, a Github Action is triggered to create a new release.

**Note ‚ö†Ô∏è**

At this time, we are not running `yarn build` in GitHub CI because we are not sure how much time it would take for the entire data set and if we need
to externalize our database in the cloud.
